# Form

The `Form` component is used to provide a consistent logical and UI framework for forms across an application, complete with a proprietary `FormContext` that assists in applying a consistent theme to compatible child elements (also included in this library) and a modified action prop that allows for server actions with more complex state management.

<Canvas of={FormStories.Default} />

### TailwindCSS configuration
To take full advantage of `FormContext`, which dynamically creates appropriate TailwindCSS classes based on the `primaryColor` prop, the tailwind.config.ts file will need to be configured to "safelist" the classname patterns that will be passed into the prop. Here is an example:

```typescript
safelist: [
  { 
    pattern: /(border|text|bg)-(red|orange|yellow|green|blue|purple|pink)/,
    variants: ['hover']
  },
],
```

The `pattern` parameter defines the patterns that TailwindCSS will automatically include in the available classlist for a component to ensure that dynamically generated classnames that fit this pattern will still apply. The `variants` parameter helps ensure that specified variants of the border, text, or bg classes 

To ensure that all possible color classes included in base TailwindCSS are included, simply implement the following code in your tailwind.config.ts file:

```typescript
safelist: [
  { 
    pattern: /(border|text|bg)-(red|orange|amber|yellow|lime|green|emerald|teal|cyan|sky|blue|indigo|violet|purple|fuchsia|pink|rose|slate|gray|zinc|neutral|stone)/,
    variants: ['hover']
  },
],
```
