# Welcome to BlissKit-UI!
This component library is designed to streamline UI development with pre-styled, accessible, and flexible React components powered by Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started
This library is published on npm and can be installed as a dependency in your Next.js application. Please note that consuming this library does require Next.js version 15 or higher, as well as React and React-DOM 19 or higher.

```bash
# Install library in Next.js app using npm
npm install blisskit-ui

# Install using pnpm
pnpm add blisskit-ui
```

This library also uses TailwindCSS for styling and requires correct TailwindCSS configuration in the consuming project in order to properly render. Ensure that TailwindCSS is installed in your project (please refer to [Tailwind's Official Website](https://tailwindcss.com/) for documentation on how to do this) and implement the following in your tailwind.config.ts file in the root of your project:

```typescript
content: [
  './node_modules/blisskit-ui/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', // Library files
  // Additional configurations
]
```

This will target the library's components within node_modules. Once applied, TailwindCSS styles from this library should render correctly in the consuming application.

Once installed and configured, the library should be ready to use. You can test implementation by importing a component from the library:

```typescript
import { CardLink } from 'blisskit-ui';

function App() {
    return <CardLink title="Click Me" />
}
```
